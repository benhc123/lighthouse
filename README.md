This branch contains the Lighthouse branded version of "Crowdfunding App". You may not distribute builds from this
branch as the logo and name are proprietary.

This setup is to ensure people know what they're getting and don't end up with a "silent fork" of the app that may work
differently or not receive security updates in a timely manner, thus hurting the Lighthouse brand. You may use this
branch to reproduce the binaries distributed from vinumeris.com.
